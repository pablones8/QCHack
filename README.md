Introducció al projecte
To move in the labyrinth you need to create your circuit, applying gates to the two qubits. Depending on the final state you mesaure, in a single shot, the ball is going to move in one direction or another; so if you mesaure the |00> state the ball is going to move up, |01> down, |10> to the right and |11> to the left. The objective is to find the circuit that gives you a 100% chance to move in the direction you choose. On the other hand, if the circuit you create can collapse to diferent states the ball can go to diferent directions, depending on the probability to get each state. 

QUINES PORTES POTS UTILITZAR

To make the game more entretaining, and add other quantum concepts, you can go through walls following the rules of the tunneling efect. EXPLICAR

In order for the user to see and understand how exactly the circuit is changing the initial state for each step there is and histogram that shows the probability to get each state, in other words, it represents the final state. It is always possible to get to the finale state that you wish to go with a 100% probability, so nullifying completlly all the other states. 

There are three labyrinth versions with increasing dificulty. The objective of the first labyrinth is simply to ilustrate the behaviour of a quantum gate and become familiarized with the program. The second labyrinth aims to get across the concept of interference in a clear way. And the third, the most complicated one, is just to have some fun playing!

NO EM CONVENÇ
We tried to make a game that helped the user to understand how interference worked in the context of quantum computing, and also how quantum gates modify the state of the system, in particular we use the PORTES QUE UTILITZEM that allow a certain range of play whithout becoming intimidating to people whithout a quantum computing background.

We expand on the concept of interference when discussing the second labyrinth, however the objective of the game is to apply gates with a constuctive interference to the state you want to go to, and a destructive interference to the ones you don't want to go.
